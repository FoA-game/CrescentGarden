## CG A - Green Catcher

In the southern reaches of Auroria, an oasis stands, blooming within the embrace of Crescent Lake. This land, once known as the "Vitala-Rey Biosphere Reserve", shares a narrative as ancient as the earth itself, coursing with the blood and memories of its indigenous peoples. Yet, the Great Disruption came unbidden, turning all to dust; the forests maintained for generations were no more, leaving behind only lethal aerosols, endless deserts, and one stubborn sliver of green.

A group of survivors, yearning for a return to tradition and a natural lifestyle, left Nuovartica. They wandered the wastelands until, by the hand of fate, they were led to the very ends of the south, to Crescent Garden. Together, they clasped hands with the original inhabitants and joined to guard this precious emerald.

Their steadfastness is not just a nod to the past but a hope for the future — despite the uncertain path civilization may tread, green will once again cover this land. Amidst the desolation, they dream of a brighter world for the next generation — where sunlight dances through the leaves on a freshly scented breeze and true steak and fine wine grace the dining table.


## CG B - Second Ark

In the A.R.118, Mich Re‘nard was born in Crescent Garden, a child of both indigenous and outsider heritage. He would later become an acclaimed architect and leader, leading the construction of residential buildings known as the "Second Ark" using mud, plant fibers, and relics from nearby abandoned cities.

"I was born in this oasis, and from my earliest memories, I've been haunted by the fear of losing this green space. That fear drove me to seek a sustainable way of living — one that achieves self-sufficiency in energy, water, and food to minimize our environmental impact."

The inhabitants of this community sustain their daily lives by harvesting rainwater and harnessing solar and wind energy with greenhouses to secure their food supply. However, some youth within the community have begun to express disdain for this lifestyle. They show little concern for the future of the oasis, grumbling about the inconveniences of life, the hardships of their living conditions, and the demands of labor.

Faced with these differing opinions, Mich Re‘nard responds, "Everyone longs for convenience and comfort. However, I believe that humanity should rely less on man-made systems for life. The collapse of high-tech communities following the Great Disruption is a testament to that."


## CG C - Eden Resurgence

Fellow gardeners, today I stand before you as a member of this resilient community and witness the indomitable spirit of Crescent Garden—the last garden of human civilization.

Thanks to the relentless efforts of our community members, Crescent Garden is expanding its boundaries by 7% annually, weaving a veil of life across this once-forsaken land. Although this expansion will inevitably slow, we anticipate that this desert will once again become a lush forest within the next two centuries.

Lina Kovalenko has dedicated herself to the remarkable task of using microbes to decompose the Ceras crystals. This action has eradicated the deadly threat these crystals posed to the land, enabling flora and fauna to thrive here once more—despite the distant air currents that still carry the aerosols, casting a shadow of death over the land. Elian Martez and his team have been restoring the ecology using local plants such as sagebrush and manila, employing genetic editing to adapt them to extreme environments. By taking root in deserts and saline lands, they maintain soil moisture, improve soil quality, and lay the groundwork for the growth of more woody plants.

We have achieved initial success in ecological restoration, so let us continue to move forward together on this path of revival. We are here to survive and ensure that future generations inherit a world brimming with greenery and teeming with life.


## CG D - Demolition Compensation

In anticipation of future development needs and to achieve our shared vision of sustainable growth, we are initiating a crucial infrastructure project - the Arcadix Dam - to secure the long-term welfare of human society.

## CG E - Chicken Lover

**A.R.175, Day 218**
Woke up to find the power was out at home. Mom said something went wrong with the moss solar panels on the outer wall, half of them just died. Spent the entire afternoon replanting them, totally exhausted.

**A.R.175, Day 219**
Yay! It's chicken day again, and I even borrowed some rosemary from Uncle Hale, specially for it. The roast chicken was absolutely delicious!

**A.R.175, Day 221**
Today, Master Mich took us to visit the seed bank. He told us that one day, Auroria would be filled with plants. Sounds pretty nice, but Ela told me that "one day" might be a hundred years from now. Who cares about what happens then?

**A.R.175, Day 223**
Zue told me that in the old world, people could eat meat every day. He also said there are other cities to the north of the continent, something called New Artica. Over there, people don't have to fix their houses every day, take care of the crops in the greenhouse, or plant Manila grass in the desert.

**A.R.175, Day 224**
Zue told me he wanted to leave the oasis. I asked him if guarding the garden wasn't important. He countered, asking, what if we killed all the chickens at home for meat? I said that's impossible; those chickens need to keep laying eggs. Then he asked, what if you only had one more week to live? What's the point of chickens that can lay eggs for two more years then? I got what he meant.
