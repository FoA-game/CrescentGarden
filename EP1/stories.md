## CG A - Green Catcher

In the southern reaches of Auroria, an oasis stands, blooming within the embrace of Crescent Lake. This land, once known as the Vitala-Rey Biosphere Reserve, shares a narrative as ancient as the earth itself, coursing with the blood and memories of its Indigenous peoples. Yet, the Great Disruption came unbidden, turning all to dust; the forests maintained for generations were no more, leaving behind only lethal aerosols, endless deserts, and one stubborn sliver of green.

A group of survivors, yearning to return to tradition and a natural lifestyle, left Nuovartica. They wandered the wastelands until, by the hand of fate, they were led to the very end of the south. Together, they clasped hands with the original inhabitants and joined to guard this precious emerald.

Their steadfastness is not just a nod to the past but a hope for the future — despite the uncertain path civilization may tread, green will once again cover this land. Amidst the desolation, they dream of a brighter world for the next generation — where sunlight dances through the leaves on a freshly scented breeze and steak and wine grace the dining table.


## CG B - Second Ark

In the A.R.118, Mich Re‘nard was born in Crescent Garden, a child of both indigenous and outsider heritage. He later became an acclaimed architect and leader, leading the construction of residential buildings known as the "Second Ark" using mud, plant fibers, and relics from nearby abandoned cities.

"I was born in this oasis, and from my earliest memories, I've been haunted by the fear of losing this green space. That fear drove me to seek a sustainable way of living — one that achieves self-sufficiency in energy, water, and food to minimize our environmental impact."

The inhabitants of this community sustain their daily lives by harvesting rainwater and harnessing solar and wind energy with greenhouses to secure their food supply. However, the younger generation struggles to embrace this way of life. They resent the endless labor and long for comfort and convenience. Some even dream of leaving the oasis to explore the northern cities. Despite the doubts, Mich remains resolute: "The collapse of high-tech communities after the Great Disruption proved the fragility of relying on man-made systems. We must find our own path, no matter how difficult the journey may be."

## CG C - Eden Resurgence

Dear gardeners,

Today, we gather not only to mourn Lina Kovalenko but to honor the priceless legacy she has left for Crescent Garden.
In those darkest days, Lina led us to face the shadow of death. She found hope in microorganisms, successfully breaking down the deadly Ceras crystals and turning cursed wastelands into cradles of life. It was her relentless dedication and fearless courage that reignited the green spark in the silent desert.

Her teammate, Elian Martez, once described her: "Lina was a beacon to us all. She pioneered the breakdown of Ceras crystals and domesticated desert grasses, turning them into guardians of life. Her efforts laid the foundation for more plants to flourish. Lina didn’t just change this land; she changed our future."

But fate cruelly ended her life. In a sudden Ceras storm, Lina gave her team the chance to live while she herself fell forever. Her final words were: "Take hope back. Let it root and grow in this land."

Now, in the place where Lina fell, a new forest has begun to sprout. The boundaries of Crescent Garden are expanding at a rate of 7% per year, and in the next two centuries, this desert is expected to be replaced by lush, thriving forests. Their dream is steadily becoming a reality.

Let us remember Lina’s name and carry forward her unfinished mission. May the greenery endure and may hope be everlasting.

## CG E - Chicken Lover

**A.R.175, Day 218**
Woke up to find the power was out at home. Mom said something went wrong with the moss solar panels on the outer wall, half of them just died. Spent the entire afternoon replanting them, totally exhausted.

**A.R.175, Day 219**
Yay! It's chicken day again, and I even borrowed some rosemary from Uncle Hale, specially for it. The roast chicken was absolutely delicious!

**A.R.175, Day 221**
Today, Master Mich took us to visit the seed bank. He told us that one day, Auroria would be filled with plants. Sounds pretty nice, but Ela told me that "one day" might be a hundred years from now. Who cares about what happens then?

**A.R.175, Day 223** 
Kara died today. The rain carried Ceras. She was out in the desert with nowhere to hide.

**A.R.175, Day 224**
Zue told me that in the old world, people could eat meat every day. He also said there are other cities to the north of the continent, something called New Artica. Over there, people don't have to fix their houses every day, take care of the crops in the greenhouse, or plant Manila grass in the desert.

**A.R.175, Day 225**
Zue told me he wanted to leave the oasis. I asked him if guarding the garden wasn't important. He countered, asking, what if we killed all the chickens at home for meat? I said that's impossible; those chickens need to keep laying eggs. Then he asked, what if you only had one more week to live? What's the point of chickens that can lay eggs for two more years then? I thought about it for a long time, and suddenly, I think I understand what he meant.
